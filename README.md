UPSC Prelims: This is the screening stage, consisting of two objective-type papers: General Studies Paper I and General Studies Paper II (CSAT). While Paper I covers a broad range of subjects including History, Geography, Polity, Economy, Environment, and Science, with a strong emphasis on current affairs, Paper II is a qualifying paper testing aptitude, comprehension, and logical reasoning.
UPSC Mains: This stage is descriptive and comprises nine papers, designed to assess a candidate's in-depth knowledge, analytical capabilities, and ability to articulate ideas effectively. The papers include Essay, General Studies I, II, III, IV, two language papers (qualifying), and two optional subject papers. The Mains marks are crucial for the final merit list.
UPSC Interview (Personality Test): The final stage evaluates a candidate's personality, intellectual qualities, mental alertness, critical powers of assimilation, clear and logical exposition, balance of judgment, variety and depth of interest, ability for social cohesion and leadership, and moral integrity.
Success in the UPSC CSE requires a holistic approach, consistent effort, and expert guidance to master each stage. This is precisely where a coaching institute like Plutus IAS plays a transformative role.
